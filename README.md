For Day 10, Mean2 = 4.6 from the data table. Find Probability P(X<t1)+P(X>t2) (Two-Tails Test values) so as to compare with Type-1 error α = 0.05

For Day 15, Mean2 = 3.8 from the data table. Find Probability P(X<t1)+P(X>t2) (Two-Tails Test values) so as to compare with Type-1 error α = 0.05

For Day 13, Mean2 = 4.0 from the data table. Find Probability P(X<t1)+P(X>t2) (Two-Tails Test values) so as to compare with Type-1 error α = 0.05
